# mididrums

Work in progress, probably won't work.

# current plan:
- drum pads are in two banks of four. Each bank has one ground line and 4 power lines.

- can use this matrix to drive each pad and a single ADC to get voltage - how long for this to settle?

- That means 1 ground line (transistor probably better) and 4 power lines and 1 ADC line from GPIO.
